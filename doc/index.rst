Colombia Atlas of Economic Complexity
=====================================

This is the documentation for the Colombia Atlas of Economic complexity. It's
generated from the code comments, and the .rst files in the `/docs/` directory
of the project, using Sphinx.

To add to this documentation, a good place to check out is the reStructuredText
`primer`_ on the Sphinx homepage, as well as the parts about
`cross-referencing`_ to other parts of the documentation. `Autodoc`_ provides the
functionality to generate API docs from comments.
